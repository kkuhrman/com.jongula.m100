The M100 is a high efficiency, mono-crystalline PV solar cell mounted on a plastic protective case and presoldered to top-facing (+/-) terminals. It is well suited to applications such as prototyping and classroom experimentation where frequent manipulation of solar cell arrays might be necessary. The plastic case protects the solar cell from breakage and the top facing terminals make it easy to connect other cells in series or array configurations.
